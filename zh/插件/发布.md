Obsidian 为你提供了一站式的个人网站搭建服务，你可以通过发布插件将库中的笔记发布到个人网站上。

更多关于 Obsidian 发布服务的信息，比如它实现方法、隐私协议等，请看 [[Obsidian 发布服务|这篇笔记]]。

### 打开插件

你可以在 `设置` -> `核心插件` 中打开发布插件。开启后，Obsidian 的左边栏中会增加一个纸飞机一样的按钮。你可以通过点击按钮来使用发布功能，也可以通过命令面板或快捷键来完成操作。

### 配置你的网站

在发布插件中，你可以通过输入一个唯一的网站 ID 来创建你的网站。这样，你的网站就可以在 `https://publish.obisidian.md/{网站-id}` 上访问。

输入好网站 ID 以后，你可以给你的网站起一个名字，选择一个主页，设置一个主题，并决定是否开启关系图谱、大纲等网站组件。

### 选择需要发布的文件

设置完网站以后，你可以开始发布你的笔记。

由于网站处于新建成的状态，因此你所有发布的笔记都会出现在“新建”部分，意味着这是新加入网站的笔记。此时，你可以选择要发布的文件，然后点击 `发布` 按钮将其发布。

==隐私方面的提示：Obsidian 的发布服务并不会检测、也不会保留那些你不打算发布的以及从网站上删除的笔记。==

### 修改

你可以对已发布的笔记进行修改。当你打开发布插件时，本地修改过的笔记会被自动选中，你只需要取消勾选那些你不想发布到网站的笔记即可。

### 更改网站设置

You can change various site options by clicking on the gear icon near your site name when in the "Publish changes" dialogue.

#### Metadata

In this section, you can set site name, home page file (the file visitors see when they land on your site), and manage custom domain (please see [[Obsidian Publish#Custom domain|this guide]] to set up your custom domain).

#### Appearance

Here you can change the theme between light and dark.

If you want more customization, you can look into setting up [[Obsidian Publish#Custom CSS|custom CSS]] and [[Obsidian Publish#Favicon|favicon]].

#### Reading experience

In this section, you can:

- Enable a special mode called "sliding windows" that looks like [Andy Matuschak's notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/);
- Enable page preview on hover like when using [[Page preview]] plugin in the app;
- Configure whether you want readable line length and strict line breaks.

#### Components

Your site comes with a few components that you can toggle on or off. These include:

- File explorer (default on)
- Local graph (default on)
- Outline (default off)
- Backlink at the bottom (default off)
- Search bar (default off, requires file explorer)

#### Security

Here you can set passwords to protect your site. Once set, all visitors need to enter one of the passwords to enter your site.

Multiple passwords facilitate sharing with multiple groups. When you no longer wish to share with one group of visitors, you can simply delete that password. Each password can be named for your convenience as well.

As of 2021/01/20, all notes on your site are protected by the same set of passwords.

### Add linked notes

The "Add linked" button allows you to include for publishing any notes in your vault that are referenced (linked to) by any currently selected notes. This is a good way to ensure there are no dead links on your published site.

By way of example, let's assume you select Note A for publishing. Supposing Note A has links to Note P, Note Q, and Note R, then if you click the "Add linked" button, Notes P, Q, and R will all be selected for publishing along with the currently selected Note A.

Each time you click the "Add linked" button, the Publish plugin will look for links within every currently selected file to include for publication. Please be sure you review the list of selected files before clicking the "Publish" button.

### Delete published notes

You always have the option of removing any notes that have been published to your site. Within the Publish plugin, all published notes will be listed, of which any/all can be selected for removal. Deleting a note from your site **does not** remove the note from your vault, thus giving you the option to re-publish the note again in the future.

### Delete entire site

If you'd like to delete an entire site, click the switch-site (arrows) icon near the top of the Publish plugin. Then click the X button to delete your site. Note: this only removes your public site but does not affect any files in your vault. You can always choose to re-publish your notes.
